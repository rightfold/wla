There should be two configuration files: the configuration file and the
crawlers file.

The configuration file contains settings such as the address to listen on.

The crawlers file defines all crawlers. This file contains tokens so it should
only be readable by the user that needs to be able to read it.

Sending SIGHUP to the daemon should reload the crawlers file and run all
crawlers.
