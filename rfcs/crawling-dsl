Add a free monad DSL for writing crawlers. This has advantages over directly
using http-client. Interpreter transformers can be written that add various
aspects of crawling to the base interpreter of the DSL. Such aspects include
waiting between requests (to avoid rate limits), keeping track of cookies, and
logging requests.

Rewrite the existing crawlers to use the new DSL.
